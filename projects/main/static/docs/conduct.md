## The Pledge

In order to be a contributor to any of our projects you must uphold the following pledge:

1) Be excellent to one another. (Party on, dude!)
2) Never intentionally cause harm to one of our projects, our codebases, our community, or members of our community.

## The Standards

What does it mean to be "excellent"?

- The only good criticism is constructive criticism.
- As a rule of thumb, personal attacks of any kind are unwelcome distractions. Just don't do it!
- Nobody likes advertisers, spammers, solicitation, or other such annoyances. Don't be that guy!
- Don't penalize someone for asking for help. We've all been there. If you have the time, maybe help a brother out?

What does it mean to intentionally cause harm?

- Everyone makes mistakes. You'll never be punished for pushing a bad commit or making one of those typical human 
errors we all fall victim to, the road to success is paved with a multitude of failures. Intentional harm is malicious, 
it's malware, adware, or other intentional forms of mischief or chaos that is antithetical to project success.
- Where our community and people are concerned, you shouldn't have any problems if you circle back to the first pledge: 
Just. Be. Excellent. ðŸ˜Ž

## Scope and Enforcement

Look, we're not going to police behavior off the clock. If you do some questionable stuff outside the context of our 
projects and our community, that's your business and your private life so long as it doesn't blow back on our 
space, our projects, or our community.

**However**, if you do cause mayhem in our community, if you do intentionally cause harm, if you are clearly 
_not being excellent_... you will not be a contributor much longer. We'll cut you a couple mulligans for small stuff, 
we understand people make mistakes, but big offenses like hate-speech, bigotry, malicious codeâ€”that's THE BOOT!
