# ✨ Credits

## Our Supporters

Above all else, we'd like to thank and credit our amazing [Patreon supporters](), without whom this project could not 
be supported in perpetuity. You guys really make the difference! If you'd like to support our projects, please consider

continually improve the app.

## Chilli Axe

Chilli Axe's original [MTG Photoshop Automation](https://github.com/chilli-axe/mtg-photoshop-automation) project was the 
inspiration for building Proxyshop. Most of our original PSD templates were modifications of templates he created for 
that project, the bones of which are still present in many of our traditional "raster" templates today. He also 
developed the original NDPMTG mana symbol font that our Proxyglyph font is based on. Without his incredible work that 
came before, Proxyshop likely would have never existed. We love you Chilli :heart:
